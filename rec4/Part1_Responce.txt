I would personally use a Linked List as opposed to a dynamic array.
The reason why I would choose a Linked List would be because, A linked List
would not consummed as much memory resource as a dynamic array. Also, since
we aren't worring about sorthing the list, this makes it perfect to implement
the "...og entries will be written to the file in the same order they were 
collected." aspect of the task. We can use sentinels to figure out more 
efficiently which one was the last added log entry without having to worry about
size. One thing that I would argue agains using linked list would be that; it would
be harder to get a log that is on index n since, we would have to iterate through the
whole list, as opposed to, return array[n].
