Before running the code:

The function will initialize variables i and t and they will have random data assigned to them.
j is going to equal to n
s is going to equal 1

Since s is equal to 1 the while loop will run (since 1 is equivalent to True)
Then it will set s = 0
Then a for loop is initialized; i is assigned 0, and the loop will run as long as i is less than j, once an iteration of the loop is finished it will
  increase i by 1.
There is an if statement comparing the items at possition i in array x with the items at possitions i-1 in array x. (current < prev values)
If the if statement is true then t will adopt the value of the possition i in array x. then the current possition (i) of the x array will adopt
  the value of the prev possition (i-1), the prev possition will then adopt the value of t, and s is assigned the value of 1; allowing the while loop
  to repeat again.

Main has an array of ints by the name of x, there is an int value by the name of n that has the result of the size of the array x divided by the value
  at the 0 place in the array x, the int i is initialize with random data.
The first for loop sets the value of i equal to 0, then as long as i is less than n it will execuse the code, every iteration i is incremented by 1.
The loop first prints the value that it's on the i iteration of the x array, then if i is equal to n-1 it will print out a new line, else a space.
Once the foor loop is done we use the function "function" and pass the values of x(array) and n(int).
We then repeat the same for loop as before. (line 18)

My prediction:

15, 56, 12, -21, 1, 659, 3, 83, 51, 3, 135, 0
-21, 0, 1, 3, 3, 12, 15, 51, 56, 83, 135, 659
