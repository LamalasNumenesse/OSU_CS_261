The function takes two arguments; num and ctr.
We initialize var i with random memory stored in it
We have a for loop that assigns 2 to i, and as long as i is less than or equal to half of num it will iterate, we arguments
  also increasing i by one
inside the first for loop we are comparing if the remainder of num div by i equal 0, if it is we are increasing ctr by one
  and we force quit the for loop
outside of the for loop (still inside the function) we check if ctr equals 0 and num does not equal 1, if this is the case
  we return 1, else we return 0

In the main function we initialize the values num with random values, ctr with the value of 0, and r with the value of negative 1
We then ask the user to input a number (does not specify the range) and promps us a space to input our number.
We assing r to equal the result of the function; with the function being call with num and ctr as arguments
We then print out r and quit the program

prediction: it will depend on what we input

if num is negative then it will always default to 1
else if num is 1 then it will return 0, and if our input (num) is even (with the exeption of 2) it will print out 0, else 1.
